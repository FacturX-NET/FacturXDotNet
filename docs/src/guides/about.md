Hi! Iâ€™m Ismail Bennani, the creator and maintainer of FacturX.NET.
This project began as a personal challenge to build a fast and resource-efficient library for handling Factur-X invoices. Over time, it evolved into a clean, modern, and developer-friendly toolkit designed to make working with Factur-X as smooth as possible.

Iâ€™ve poured a lot of time and care into building this library, and Iâ€™m excited to keep improving it with your feedback and ideas.

If youâ€™d like to get in touch, contribute, or support the project:
