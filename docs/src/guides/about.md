Hi! Iâ€™m Ismail Bennani, the creator and maintainer of FacturX.NET.
This project started as a personal need for a clean, modern, and developer-friendly way to handle Factur-X invoices in .NET, and as a challenge to make it as fast and as ressource efficient as possible.

Iâ€™ve poured a lot of time and care into building this library, and Iâ€™m excited to keep improving it with your feedback and ideas.
