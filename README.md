The FacturX.NET library is a high-performance .NET library ([benchmarks](https://github.com/ismailbennani/FacturXDotNet/tree/master/Benchmark)) that provides support for the
FacturX data formats, as defined by the [FNFE](https://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/) (also known as ZUGFeRD in Germany).

These formats are the main formats used in the french and german electronic invoicing systems.

It comes in multiple flavors:

- a [CLI tool](https://github.com/ismailbennani/FacturXDotNet/tree/master/FacturXDotNet.CLI)
- a [desktop editor](#) (coming soon)
- a [web API](#) (coming soon)
- a [web app](#) (coming soon)
- a [.NET library](https://github.com/ismailbennani/FacturXDotNet/tree/master/FacturXDotNet)

All these tools provide the same set of features.
